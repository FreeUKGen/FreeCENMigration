Issue tracking for project migrating FreeCEN to F2 architecture


FreeCen works on a branch from our FreeReg project (MyopicVicar) and is an open-source genealogical record database and search engine. It is the software that powers the FreeREG database of parish register entries and the FreeCEN database of UK census records.

The tool has been developed by Free UK Genealogy, a registered charity dedicated to making genealogical information freely available online. It is released under the Apache 2.0 license.
We Need You!

Volunteers are essential to every part of the project. We welcome contributions to the software, documentation, and to the records themselves.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for details on ways to contribute.
Architecture

As with FreeReg (Myopic Vicar), FreeCen uses MongoDB to allow researchers to search heterogeneous records. Both FreeREG and FreeCEN projects accept volunteer contributions as spreadsheets, while metadata, quality control and coordination provided by volunteer coordinators and data managers.

Please see Installation Instructions for more information.
